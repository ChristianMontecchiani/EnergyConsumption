# Let's start analyzing each column

# The first column is the date. Since it is a date it is possible to convert in datetime,
# which will be useful to plot data
BaselinePeriod$date <- as.POSIXct(BaselinePeriod$date, format="%Y-%m-%d") 

# It contains all the dates from the 01/11/2017 to 31/03/2018

# The second column is 'DayOfTheWeek', which is an int variable but it represents Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday
# So it does not make sense having operation such as +, -, /, * over days. So we convert to factor.
BaselinePeriod$DayOfTheWeek <- as.factor(BaselinePeriod$DayOfTheWeek)

# Third column is the daily mean temperature in Celsius
# It can be analyzed through the use of box plots to highlight some outliers 
boxplot(BaselinePeriod$Text, main="Daily mean average temperature", col="red")
# As it is possible to see from the box plot there are no outliers 

# Fourth column is the "Iext" daily average solar radiance
# It can be analyzed through the use of box plots to highlight some outliers 
boxplot(BaselinePeriod$Iext, main="Daily mean solar radiance", col="blue")
# As it is possible to see there is a single outlier which corresponds to the max value of the data set 
# We can delete the single outlier
max_iext <-max(BaselinePeriod$Iext)
BaselinePeriod <- BaselinePeriod[BaselinePeriod$Iext != max_iext, ]
View(BaselinePeriod)
# The value of the 20/02/2018 has been deleted

# Let's analyze the last variable which is the Energy Consumption
boxplot(BaselinePeriod$Energy, main="Daily Energy consumption", col="green")
# As it is possible to see from the box plot there are no outliers

# We can normalize all data that are numeric 
# So we define a function to do that
